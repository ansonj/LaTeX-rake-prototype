# LaTeX + rake prototype

## What is this?

A handful of `.tex` files, plus a `Rakefile`, so you can quickly get started writing a beautifully-typset and fully-cited paper.

## What is LaTeX?

Text and code go in, pretty document comes out.

[Read this](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX); it's everything you need to know.

## Todo

- Add `$use_bibtex` option to top of rakefile so you can easily turn it off if desired (?)
    - Don't create tasks if the flag is `false`
